This repository is for practice to get to know the GitHub flow
I am an accountant in corporate banking for retail and payments. I have always been interested in developing and creating things on the web and am fascinated with the world wide web. I am learning about software, programming, and development of tools to help me in my career and to create new and interesting things/ideas. I do not know any programming languages so I am very green- please be patient with me and understand that I am doing my best to learn. I am highly self-critical and self-motivated and am thirsty for knowledge and experience.
